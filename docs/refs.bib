  abstract = {JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight, text-based,
              language-independent data interchange format. It was derived from
              the ECMAScript Programming Language Standard. JSON defines a small
              set of formatting rules for the portable representation of
              structured data. This document removes inconsistencies with other
              specifications of JSON, repairs specification errors, and offers
              experience-based interoperability guidance.},
