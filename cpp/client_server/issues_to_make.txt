1. Set up test cases to make sure we know how to send data



Sample cases to start encoding:

Asks for page, give back u32
Asks for page, give back u64
Asks for page, give back other primitive numbers f32, etc

Asks for page, give back fixed size list of u32
Asks for page, give back variable size list of u32

Have a vec3 class x y z all f64
Asks for page, give back scheme for vec3, then a vec3 if the client doesn't know what it is
